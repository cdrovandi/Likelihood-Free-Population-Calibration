# Likelihood-Free-Population-Calibration

Matlab and Julia code to support the article Population Calibration using Likelihood-Free Bayesian Inference (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01962.pdf).

Each folder contains code for an example of the paper:

- mixture example: start with run_sl.m
- growth example: start with run.m
- internalisation example: This example is taken from a previous paper (Browning et al 2021) where we originally applied our method. 
                           Calls code available at https://github.com/ap-browning/internalisation (run from the root directory).
                           The file InternalisationPredictive.jl then produces more results.

Within each folder there is a produce_results.m file that can be run to reproduce the figures in the paper.

Some files to facilitate the visualisation of the results have been obtained from freely available sources:
