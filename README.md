# Likelihood-Free-Population-Calibration

Matlab and Julia code to support the article Population Calibration using Likelihood-Free Bayesian Inference.

Each folder contains code for an example of the paper:

- mixture example: start with run_sl.m
- growth example: start with run.m
- internalisation example: Calls code available at https://github.com/ap-browning/internalisation (run from the root directory).
  The file InternalisationPredictive.jl then produces more results.

Some files to supporting visualising the results have been obtained from freely available sources:
